# Exploring Timing attacks

## Overview
This project implements a naive password-cracking approach based on timing variations in password validation. It includes a graphical interface under development and a timing attack demonstration.

## Features
- **Naive Timing-Based Password Cracker**: Exploits response time differences to infer correct characters.
- **Graphical User Interface (WIP)**: A UI for interacting with the cracking process.
- **Timing Attack Demonstration**: A practical implementation to show the impact of timing leaks.
- **Tests**: Jupyter notebook for running experiments and verifying results.
